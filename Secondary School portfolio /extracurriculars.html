      <h2>In my free time, I like studying and solving Math questions. I started taking AMC 8 and AMC 10 in 2018. I got into the top 5% of AMC 8 because of the effort I spent on studying different kinds of problems that often occur in AMC 8. However, the difficulty for AMC 10 makes me realize that I am not even close to being a master in Math. And that encouraged me to study hard and keep improving.  </h2>

      <h2>I also like coding very much. After learning from my parents and from school, I started doing USACO (USA Computer Olympiad) on my own. But it is very hard, therefore, I asked my computer science teacher Mr. Klett for help. He kindly helped me and taught me a lot of things along the way.  </h2>

      <h2>When I was in 5th grade, I fell in love with aviation. It fascinates me, and I study it hard with my friends. We started from no knowledge, then to designing our own planes. We even started a "company" called CSPS! You remember the strange blue and red symbol you see when you click to get into this page? Yes, it is the symbol we created for our company.</h2>
